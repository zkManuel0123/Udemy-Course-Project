# Udemy Course Projects of Web development
**Project 1: Dice Game | HTML, CSS, JS**

  *Developed an interactive dice game, allowing two players to roll dice and display the winner based on random dice rolls.*
- Implemented JS to generate random numbers, update DOM elements using querySelector() and setAttribute(), and dynamically display the result using If statements.

**Bootcamp Project 2: Drum Kit Game | HTML, CSS, JS**

  *Developed an interactive web-based "Drum Kit" game using JavaScript.*
- Implemented event listeners to detect both button clicks and keyboard presses, triggering corresponding drum sounds.
- Utilized the Audio object in JavaScript to play sound files dynamically based on user interactions.
- Created a visual feedback mechanism using CSS class toggling, providing an animation effect when a button is pressed.
- Applied DOM manipulation to link user inputs with specific sounds, enhancing the user experience through intuitive controls.
  
**Bootcamp Project 3: Simon Game | HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery**

  *Developed a browser-based implementation of the classic Simon game*
- Programmed the game's logic to dynamically generate color sequences, track user interactions, and verify input correctness using JavaScript functions such as checkAnswer().
- Integrated user feedback through visual effects (button animations and game-over screen flashes) and audio feedback using the playSound() function, playing relevant sound clips based on the user's actions.
- Implemented a game-over sequence that provides immediate feedback, including resetting the game state and displaying a "Game Over" message on the screen.
- Ensured the game follows the correct flow with randomized color sequences via nextSequence(), user sequence validation, and level progression with corresponding updates to the UI.
- Utilized jQuery for event handling, manipulating DOM elements (e.g., adding/removing CSS classes like "game-over"), and enhancing interactivity through animations (e.g., button flash on click).
- Applied error handling by resetting the game when the user provides an incorrect sequence and allowing them to restart by pressing any key.
